# Senpy
Note: Code doesnt work anymore due to cloudflare bypass
Uses webscraping and a gui module called kivy to provide users with the ability to download anime in bulk 
Tutorial:
One Initialization of Senpy your gonna see a Text field 
In this field you'll need to enter an anime name Japanese or English name i think it'll work for both most of the time
After that Press The Enter Button
A dialog will Pop up to and give you instructions(follow them)
After following the instruction in the Dialog 
Press Begin
Then youll See 2 New text fields show up
The first Field requires a digit(1,2,3,4,5)
In the first field enter the first anime you want.
say you want naruto episode 5 to naruto episode 25
You would enter in the first field 5 and in the second field 20
Bcos 20 episodes after epsiode 5 is episode 25(senpy starts counting at 1)
Press the download button after adding approiate data in each field 
Depending on how much total episodes you asked for thats how long senpy will take to get links on each.
You can Press the Button at the Buttom Left to See the download progress
